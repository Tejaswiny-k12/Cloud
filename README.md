# A Cloud-Based Framework for Anomaly Detection in Medical IoT Devices

## 📌 Overview

This is a lightweight, cloud-native monitoring platform that detects abnormal behavior in healthcare IoT devices using machine learning. It simulates real-time telemetry (e.g., heart rate, battery level), securely stores the data securely stores telemetry and anomaly logs locally and flags anomalies like device flooding, data spikes, or unexpected silence. Alerts are visualized through an interactive dashboard to help hospital teams respond quickly and avoid security breaches or device failures.


## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Real-time telemetry ingestion from simulated IoT devices  
- 🧠 ML-based anomaly detection (Isolation Forest / LSTM)  
- ☁️ Cloud data storage 
- 📊 Live alert dashboard (Streamlit-based)  
- 🔐 Prevents potential device-level breaches and system failures  
- ⚙️ Easily extensible to real hospital IoT networks


## 🧪 Use Cases

- Hospital security teams monitoring device behavior  
- Smart clinic IoT deployments needing anomaly alerts  
- Research in healthcare IoT cybersecurity
